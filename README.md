1. project overview (readme)

this project is a custom-engineered product landing page for kidocode, focusing on their technology and entrepreneurship learning bundles (padawan, knight, and master). it is designed to be a modern, high-conversion product site similar in structure to professional equipment catalogs but tailored for an educational tech audience.

key features:

dynamic currency switcher: allows users to view hourly rates in myr, usd, and sgd.

package comparison table: a detailed breakdown of features across different tiers.

curriculum pillars: highlights of the "exposure, depth, and flexibility" philosophy.

professional inquiry system: a custom form for parents to request trial classes.

responsive design: fully functional on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

coding ethics & standards:

descriptive naming: variables and classes use semantic naming (e.g., packagePriceDisplay, faqToggleState).

original logic: code was developed specifically for this project based on requirements, avoiding direct clones.

modular css: styles are organized by section for easy maintenance.
